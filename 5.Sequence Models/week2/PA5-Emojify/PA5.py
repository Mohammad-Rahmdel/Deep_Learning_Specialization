"""
1. Even with a 127 training examples, you can get a reasonably good model for Emojifying. 
This is due to the generalization power word vectors gives you.

2. Emojify-V1 will perform poorly on sentences such as "This movie is not good and not enjoyable" because it doesn't 
understand combinations of words--it just averages all the words' embedding vectors together, without paying attention 
to the ordering of words.
