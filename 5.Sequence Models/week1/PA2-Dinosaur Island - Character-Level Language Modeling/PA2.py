"""                      Week1 - Programming Assignment 2
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) are very effective for Natural Language Processing and other sequence tasks because 
they have "memory". They can read inputs x⟨t⟩ (such as words) one at a time, and remember some information/context 
through the hidden layer activations that get passed from one time-step to the next. This allows a uni-directional RNN 
to take information from the past to process later inputs. A bidirection RNN can take context from both the past and 
the future.
